<h1 >TADA, U MADE IT !! Now All About Me:</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Sammy Lilian Martinez and I'm a film and television major with a minor in programming. I'm currently in my second semester of my junior year of college at Columbia Chicago. I know nothing about application design nor do I have any expereince in it(which I suppose is why I'm taking the class) but I think I will actually find it to be interesting, unliked learning about c#(but don't tell anyone that). I've taken programming l and 2, but that's about it so far. I'm currently taking this class and C++. I've heard it's difficult, far more than 1 which is scary because I definitley sturggled understanding that language. It's also asynchronous, and I think, as someone with a learning disability called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, I prefer learning in person. Self-teaching doesn't really work for me because I need a lot of outside help to get me to understand material, especially with things more tactical and logical like science, math,...and programming. My strengths are creatives and writing. I was in AP english classes in high school, and believe it or not I actually enjoyed them. I always liked reading growing up, (did it in my free time), I became fascinated with tv shows and movies, so analyizing different mediums and trying to find symbolisms in them intrigued me. I also just like people, learning about them, psychology, which whether you realize it or not, is often what storytelling is all about. I wanted to be an author as a kid but as I got older it turned into screen writer. Anyway, another thing, my teacher is only part-time, which means he doesn't have any office hours for me so I can stop in. The school doesn't have a tutor for this language either, in the IAM nor at the academic center. That's the scariest part! Thankfully my teacher is pretty good at answering emails and I have a lot of more wiggle room in my schedule so I should be able to see him if I need help through a virtual meeting. The teacher I had for c#(prog 1 and 2) Janell Baxter's hours were either right before our class, or during one of my other ones! She was a busy woman so she oftentimes took longer to get to me, so it was hard for me to get a hold of her when our schedules consistently conflicted! She is good at what she does, thought(teaching), so when I was able to see her it was great. It was really helpful. I just wish I had gotten to spend time with her at the beginning, so I wasn't so lost later on. What else is there to know about me? Hmm...I suppose...I run a club here! It is trans fam, a safe space for transgender people. I thought it was important to announce considering the state of the political climate of our country right now. Trans people have always and will continue to exist! You don't have to be lgbt to go, anyone is welcome! We do chill things like color, crafts, movies, board games, shopping, education, field trips, and more.  All of our e board happens to be queer, though, obviously including me. I've happen to go through a few labels in my life: aromantic, pansexual, bisexual, lesbian, transgender, bigender, non-binary etc. Lately I'm not sure enough to feel comfortable to put a label on anything. I know I sometimes feel like a boy, then a girl, then neither. I also know I have a strong prefernce for dating people in the lgbt community than cisgender heterosexual men. Labels are generally unecessary anyway because sexuality and gender are fluid! They exist only for the certian people who find it helpful.
Okay I think I've rambled enough for today, hope you all have a good night. Goodbye!
