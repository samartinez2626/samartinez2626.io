<p>Hi, my name is Sam Lilian Martinez and I'm a film major with a minor in programming. I'm currently in my second semester of my junior year of college at Columbia. I know nothing about application design nor do I have any expereince of it(which I suppose is why I'm taking the class) but I think I will actually find it to be interesting. </p>
